Additionally, ICG has working groups which meet via hangouts/skype and also conducts code sprints to continue projects from hack/doc events.\r\nGeneral communication and meeting announcements happen via the islandora-consortium-group@googlegroups.com mailing list. Working groups or project teams may have mailing lists for discussions specific to that team or project.\r\n\r\n* More Information: [ICG About Us](http://islandora-collaboration-group.github.io/icg_information/)\r\n\r\n## Members\r\n\r\n* 3CDL (Hampshire College, Mount Holyoke, Smith College)\r\n* [Barnard College](http://digitalcollections.barnard.edu)\r\n* [Grinnell College](https://digital.grinnell.edu/)\r\n* [Hamilton College](http://dhinitiative.org)\r\n* [Vassar College](https://digitallibrary.vassar.edu)\r\n* Wesleyan University\r\n* [Williams College](http://unbound.williams.edu)\r\n\r\n## Highlighted Projects\r\n\r\n* [ICG CSV Import](http://islandora-collaboration-group.github.io/icg_csv_import/)\r\n* [ICG Islandora Unit Tests](https://islandora-collaboration-group.github.io/icg_islandora_unit_tests/)\r\n* [ICG Drupal Spinner](http://islandora-collaboration-group.github.io/drupalspinner/)\r\n\r\n## How to participate\r\n\r\n* Send a request to the ICG (islandora-consortium-group@googlegroups.com)\r\n",
