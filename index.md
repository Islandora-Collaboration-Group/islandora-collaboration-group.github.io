# Islandora Collaboration Group (ICG)

## About Us

The Islandora Collaboration Group (ICG), founded in 2012, is a consortium of primarily liberal arts colleges collaborating to support and extend the Islandora digital repository through direct development, resource pooling, and advocacy. The ICG holds monthly steering committee meetings to develop strategy and organization and plan progress. The ICG created the [ISLE](https://github.com/Islandora-Collaboration-Group/ISLE) and [LASIR](https://github.com/Islandora-Collaboration-Group/LASIR) projects (as well as other repositories), and holds friendly hack/doc meetings twice a year for code and documentation development (open to all members). General communication and meeting announcements happen via the islandora-consortium-group@googlegroups.com mailing list.
